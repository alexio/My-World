Testplan:

The indexer for assignment 3 was changed to this format:

	<number of files>
	<number of words>
	<name>file name</name><name>file name</name>...</name>
	<list> filename
	<file number, file frequency>
	</list>
	.
	.
	.

For this assignment, we used the file name "result.txt",
which contain elements from our pa4 directory.

In SA, if one (or more) of the terms doesn't exist, such as "sa i love this", 
the program will output:
	Term doesn't exist: love
	No file contained all the terms you desired or no search terms were inputed

In SO, if one (or more) of the terms doesn't exist, such as "so i love this",
the program will output:
	Term doesn't exist: love
	Files containing at least one term:
	File -> ./index
	File -> ./search.c
	File -> ./makefile
